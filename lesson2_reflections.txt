What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new repo with .git file that contains the metadata info.
You need to run the command "git init"

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is where you add files before you commit them to the repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By adding only those files that have changed that make logical sense.
