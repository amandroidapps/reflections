When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is the same as auto commit; there will be a lot of unwanted commits on the remote.
